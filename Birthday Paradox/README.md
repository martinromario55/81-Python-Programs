# BIRTHDAY PAR ADOX

The Birthday Paradox, also called the Birthday Problem, is the surprisingly high probability that two people will have the same birthday even in a small group of people.

In a group of 70 people, there’s a 99.9 percent chance
of two people having a matching birthday. But even
in a group as small as 23 people, there’s a 50 percent chance of a matching birthday. 

This program performs several probability experiments to determine the percentages for groups of different sizes. We call these types of experiments, in which we conduct multiple random trials to understand the likely outcomes, Monte Carlo experiments.

### Exploring the Program
Try to find the answers to the following questions. Experiment with some modifications to the code and rerun the program to see what effect the changes have.
1. How are birthdays represented in this program? (Hint: look at line 16.)
2. How could you remove the maximum limit of 100 birthdays the program generates?
3. What error message do you get if you delete or comment out num_days =int(response) on line 53?
4. How can you make the program display full month names, such as 'January' instead of 'Jan'?
5. How could you make 'X simulations run...' appear every 1,000 simulations instead of every 10,000?
